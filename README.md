# repl-js

A Scheme repl in the browser

## Getting started

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:edwardkenfox/repl-js.git
```

Open the HTML file:

```
$ cd repl-js
$ open build/index.html
```

And you'll see a prompt window in the page which works as a scheme repl. The output is printed in the browser console, so make sure to have the devtools open.

## Acknowledgements

As also noted in src/scheme.cpp, the source code of the scheme interpreter was taken from https://gist.github.com/ofan/721464 and had been slightly modified for this project.
